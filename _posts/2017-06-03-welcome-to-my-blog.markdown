Basically I got a new job, where I expect to learn a ton since it's pretty different from what I was doing prior.  Up to this point in my career I've been building web applications, starting as a front end dev, and moving to a full stack JS engineer.  Now I'm moving into the realm of backend/network engineering with Java. 

### Primary focus
The blog should mostly be about things I'm currently working on/learning.  I will however, probably do a lot of contrasting with how this looks coming from a node.js background.  I will also include reviews of materials I read.

### Other topics will include:
- nginx
- AWS
- Software Architecture
- Life in the field of software engineering
- React and its ecosystem 

Having said that, if anyone reads this and has suggestions for reading material or really anything else [email me](mailto:radley.mith@gmail.com).

Enjoy!
