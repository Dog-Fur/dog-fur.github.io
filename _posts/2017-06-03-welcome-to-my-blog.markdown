As said in the description of the blog.  New job for some reason equals new blog, partly because I have no one to hang out with in a new city right now and partly because I've always wanted to have a blog.  I haven't always had a lot to say but with the new job I envision myself having A LOT of challenges, and probably seeming like a dummy in office for a little while, but that's okay as long as I don't stay a dummy. 

At this point in time I think the blog will mostly consist of a few things:
- The difficulty(or not) of switching from being a full stack JS web engineer to a Java, nginx, network-ish engineer
- Thoughts about on call rotations, both good and bad.  Full disclosure, I've had them at multiple jobs
- Reviews of materials I've read
- General thoughts about software engineering, team structures, architecture, and how to be successful. (TBH I don't know if I can really consider myself successful so take any of that talk with a grain of salt)

Having said that, if anyone reads this and has suggestions for reading material or really anything else [email me](mailto:radley.mith@gmail.com).

Enjoy!
