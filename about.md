I'm a software engineer. I like hiking/walking through the woods, snowboarding, dogs, and cats, not necessarily in that order. Suggestions, [email me](radley.mith@gmail.com).

I think the blog will mostly consist of a few things:
- The difficulty(or not) of switching from being a full stack JS web engineer to a Java, nginx, network-ish engineer
- Thoughts about on call rotations, both good and bad.  Full disclosure, I've had them at multiple jobs
- Reviews of materials I've read
- General thoughts about software engineering, team structures, architecture, and how to be successful. (TBH I don't know if I can really consider myself successful so take any of that talk with a grain of salt)
- Dogs
- Cats
- Snowboarding
